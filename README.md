# **Drawing Rectangles**

This project is part of the Piscine-GO programming course and focuses on drawing rectangles using the Go programming language. The goal is to write functions that can generate different types of rectangles based on given width and height values.

The project consists of five main functions: QuadA, QuadB, QuadC, QuadD, and QuadE. Each function is responsible for drawing a specific type of rectangle with different patterns. The functions take two integer parameters, `x` (width) and `y` (height), and output the corresponding rectangle pattern.

The rectangles are drawn using specific characters and patterns according to the provided examples. The functions check if `x` and `y` are positive numbers before generating the rectangles. If either `x` or `y` is not positive, the functions will not print anything.

The project provides usage examples for each function, demonstrating how to call them with different `x` and `y` values and showing the expected output. These examples can be used to test the correctness of the implemented functions.

This project provides an opportunity to practice Go programming and gain experience in generating different rectangle patterns based on given dimensions.
